# Task Scheduler

The Task Scheduler module is a high-performance task execution platform designed to overcome the limitations of
conventional server architectures.

## Overview

In many traditional systems, every computation—regardless of its resource demands—is performed on the primary service
server, leading to significant inefficiencies and potential bottlenecks.

Historically, this centralized approach prompted the development of load balancing and microservices, enabling
distributed and scalable processing. Building on that legacy, our Task Scheduler brings these proven principles into
plugin development.

Even though the Bukkit API is tightly bound to Java, this module demonstrates that resource-intensive computations or
IO-bound tasks can be delegated to specialized servers or languages that excel in these areas.

## Implemented

- [**Rust**](task-scheduler-rust/README.md) - A high-performance task scheduler written in Rust

## Client API

- [**bukkit-grpc-client**](bukkit-grpc-client/README.md) - Off-the-shelf APIs with direct gRPC backend communication.
